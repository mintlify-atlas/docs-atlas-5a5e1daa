## Verify installation

After installation, you should see the Shades of Purple color scheme applied throughout your editor:

- **Purple background** with carefully selected shade (#2D2B55)
- **Syntax highlighting** with vibrant, high-contrast colors
- **Bold purple** accents in the UI elements
- **Comments** in a softer purple (#B362FF)

<Info>
If the colors don't look quite right, make sure you've selected "Shades of Purple" from the Color Theme menu, not "Shades of Purple (Super Dark)" unless you specifically want the darker variant.
</Info>

## Available theme variants

Shades of Purple comes with two variants:

1. **Shades of Purple** - The original, carefully balanced theme
2. **Shades of Purple (Super Dark)** - A darker variant currently in BETA

You can switch between variants at any time from the Color Theme menu.

## Troubleshooting

### Theme not appearing in the list

If you don't see Shades of Purple in your Color Theme menu:

1. Make sure the extension is fully installed (check the Extensions sidebar)
2. Try reloading VS Code completely (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` > "Reload Window")
3. Check that you're searching for "Shades of Purple" not "Shade of Purple"

### Colors look different than expected

If the colors don't match what you see in screenshots:

1. Verify you've selected the correct theme variant
2. Check if you have other themes or color customizations in your settings.json
3. Disable any extensions that might modify colors (like "Custom CSS and JS Loader")

<Warning>
Some extensions may override theme colors. If you experience unexpected colors, try disabling recently installed extensions one by one to identify conflicts.
</Warning>

### Installation fails

If the installation fails:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure you're running a recent version of VS Code (1.15.0 or higher)
3. Try installing from the [VS Code Marketplace website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple) instead
