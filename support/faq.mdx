<Accordion title="What are the recommended Highlight Matching Tag settings?">
  To make the Highlight Matching Tag extension work beautifully with Shades of Purple, use these settings:

  ```json
  {
    "highlight-matching-tag.styles": {
      "opening": {
        "full": {
          "highlight": "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.3)"
