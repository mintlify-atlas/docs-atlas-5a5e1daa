## Troubleshooting Guide

Running into issues with Shades of Purple? This guide will help you resolve the most common problems.

## Theme Not Applying

If you've installed the theme but it's not showing up or applying correctly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Open the Extensions panel (`Cmd+Shift+X` or `Ctrl+Shift+X`) and search for "Shades of Purple". Make sure it shows as **installed** and **enabled**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select the theme">
    Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`), type "Color Theme", and select **Preferences: Color Theme**. Choose **Shades of Purple** from the list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reload VSCode">
    If the theme still doesn't apply, reload VSCode:
    - Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
    - Type "Reload Window"
    - Select **Developer: Reload Window**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart VSCode completely">
    If reloading doesn't work, fully quit VSCode and restart it. Sometimes a complete restart is needed for theme changes to take effect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If the theme still doesn't apply after these steps, try uninstalling and reinstalling the extension.
</Warning>

## Colors Not Showing Correctly

### Semantic Highlighting Conflicts

VSCode's semantic highlighting can sometimes override theme colors, causing unexpected appearance.

**Solution:** Disable semantic highlighting by adding this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false
}
```

<Info>
  This is included in the [Recommended Settings](/configuration/recommended-settings) for optimal theme appearance.
</Info>

### Workbench Color Customizations Conflict

If you have custom workbench color settings, they may override the theme's colors.

**Solution:** Check your `settings.json` for these settings:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {},
  "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {}
}
```

If these exist and contain values, they may be overriding Shades of Purple. Try removing or commenting them out temporarily to test.

### Font Rendering Issues

Some fonts may not render colors as vibrantly as others.

**Solution:** Try these font settings from the recommended configuration:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "Operator Mono, Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  "workbench.fontAliasing": "auto"
}
```

## Theme Not Appearing in Theme List

If Shades of Purple doesn't show up in the Color Theme picker:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check extension is enabled">
    Go to Extensions panel and make sure the theme isn't disabled. Look for a "Disabled" label.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reload extensions">
    Open Command Palette and run **Developer: Reload Window**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check for conflicts">
    Disable other theme extensions temporarily to see if there's a conflict
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reinstall the extension">
    Uninstall Shades of Purple completely, reload VSCode, then reinstall it from the marketplace
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Font Ligature Issues

If font ligatures aren't working with the theme:

### Ligatures Not Showing

**Cause:** Font ligatures need to be explicitly enabled in VSCode.

**Solution:** Add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```

<Note>
  Make sure you're using a font that supports ligatures, such as Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, Cascadia Code, or Operator Mono.
</Note>

### Ligatures Look Wrong

Some ligature combinations may not look right with certain fonts.

**Solution:** Try configuring specific ligature rules:

```json
{
  "editor.fontLigatures": "'calt', 'liga', 'dlig', 'ss01', 'ss02', 'ss03', 'ss04', 'ss05', 'ss06', 'zero'"
}
```

Adjust the features based on what your font supports.

## Italics Issues

### Don't Want Italics

Shades of Purple uses italics for certain syntax elements. If you prefer no italics:

**Solution:** See the [FAQ on disabling italics](/support/faq#how-do-i-disable-italics-in-the-theme) for detailed configuration.

### Italics Not Showing

If you want italics but they're not appearing:

**Cause:** Your font may not support italic variants.

**Solution:** Use a font with italic support like Operator Mono, Fira Code, or JetBrains Mono:

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code', 'JetBrains Mono', Menlo, Monaco, monospace"
}
```

## Extension Compatibility Issues

### Highlight Matching Tag

If the Highlight Matching Tag extension looks off with the theme:

**Solution:** Use the recommended settings:

```json
{
  "highlight-matching-tag.styles": {
    "opening": {
      "full": {
        "highlight": "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.3)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
  See [GitHub Issue #20](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode/issues/20) for more details.
</Info>

### Indent Rainbow

For better Indent Rainbow compatibility:

**Solution:** Configure colors that match the theme:

```json
{
  "indentRainbow.colors": [
    "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.1)",
    "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.2)",
    "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.3)",
    "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.4)",
    "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.5)",
    "rgba(165, 153, 233, 0.6)"
  ]
}
```

<Info>
  See [GitHub Issue #37](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode/issues/37) for the full discussion.
</Info>

### Import Cost

To make Import Cost extension colors match Shades of Purple:

**Solution:**

```json
{
  "importCost.largePackageColor": "#EC3A37F5",
  "importCost.mediumPackageColor": "#B362FF",
  "importCost.smallPackageColor": "#B362FF"
}
```

## Terminal Colors Issues

If the integrated terminal colors look wrong:

### Terminal Using Different Theme

**Cause:** VSCode terminal may have separate color settings.

**Solution:** Make sure you don't have terminal color overrides:

```json
{
  // Remove or comment out if present:
  // "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  //   "terminal.background": "...",
  //   "terminal.foreground": "..."
  // }
}
```

### Want Shades of Purple in External Terminals

The VSCode theme only affects the integrated terminal.

**Solution:** Install Shades of Purple for your external terminal:

- [iTerm2](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-iterm2)
- [Hyper](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-hyper)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-alacritty)
- [Konsole](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-konsole)
- [Ghostty](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode) (pre-installed, just enable it)

## Performance Issues

Themes typically don't cause performance issues, but if you experience slowness:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for conflicting extensions">
    Disable other theme-related extensions temporarily
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reduce tokenization load">
    Disable semantic highlighting:
    ```json
    {
      "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled": false
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check VSCode performance">
    Open Command Palette and run **Developer: Startup Performance** to identify slow extensions
  </Step>
</Steps>
